Embedded Domain Specific Languages are actually rising as a design of choice to handle small to middle sized 
problem in a declarative and efficient way. Among others, C++ is actually a pretty interesting choice as a 
host language for such development. Idioms like Expression Templates have been demonstrated to be the technique
of choice for such situation. However, they always look like some dark arcane secrets and scare potential developers
away. 

Thanks to libraries like Boost.Proto, the design and development of Expression Templates is becoming easier and easier.
More than Expression Templates, the main strength of Proto is to enable compiler-like code to be written and applied
on lazyly evaluable expression. Combined to the flexibility of C++ in terms of operator and function overloading, making
EDSL that works and are not a mess to maintain is possible.

This three hours tutorial will try to cover the basic and intermediate ground of Proto and will demonstrate that 
writing Proto enabled code is not **that** scary. The chosen subject is somethign simple : analytical derivation 
of functions and their evaluation. This is a subject I think many people here will be familliar of (or will be
quickly refreshed on) and yet give a lot of opportunity as a tutorial.

I strongly hope the ''Take Away Home'' element of this session will help spreading the use of EDSL as a C++ library
design technique and clarify what Proto is ans is not.
